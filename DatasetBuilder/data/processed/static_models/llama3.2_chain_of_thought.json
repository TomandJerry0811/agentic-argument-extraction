He tells BBC\nHereford and Worcester that Nigel Farage âconnects with peopleâs fears very,\nvery wellâ. But thatâs where the\nfavourable comments come to an end. Polanski says that far too often Farageâs politics will make things worse. He says Reform has ârocketed through\nthe polls with the politics of hate and division\".

Nottinghamshire County Council leader Mick Barton has not spoken to journalists from the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, since August. Law firm CMS LLP served the council with a legal letter on Tuesday on behalf of Reach, the organisation that runs the publisher, calling for the ban to be withdrawn in full. Barton told the BBC the authority would respond \"by teatime\" on Thursday, adding he was \"sure it'll be positive news for everyone\", without giving further details. He said: \"My door is always open, and they can come and see me. \"I want to work with everyone, I've said that from day one. Let's see what happens.\" Barton, who was speaking to the BBC earlier about a row over a local government reorganisation report, added the Post had \"been obsessed with me in the last few weeks... putting up two or three posts about me a day\". The publication declined to comment on Barton's comments when approached by the BBC. The context and scope of the ban has been unclear since it was introduced. According to the Post, it was prompted by an article about local government reorganisation, written by its agenda editor Oliver Pridmore. The council previously told the BBC the ban barred Barton and his party's councillors from speaking to the Post and the LDRS reporters \"with immediate effect\". The authority also stopped sending press releases to the publication and inviting them to council events. But Barton later clarified the ban only applied to the issuing of press releases and for him personally. At the time, senior editor Natalie Fahy said she was \"very concerned\" by the \"unprecedented ban\". In response, Barton said the party would not \"allow misinformation to shape the narrative of our governance\". Barton later lifted the ban for the three BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists, who work out of the publication.",

Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This undated photo provided by Kathy Bloomgarden shows former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers. (Kathy Bloomgarden via AP) \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology’s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet’s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania. And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.  Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world’s most valuable company — worth $550 billion in March 2000 — before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco’s stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career. Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley’s most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company’s stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago. While remaining Cisco’s chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI’s transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. \n Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s? \n A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters. In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren’t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it? ",

Brian Sandoval during the third day of the National Governors Association's meeting on Saturday in Providence, R.I. Among other things, Musk warned governors that artificial intelligence poses a \"fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk, speaking to U.S. governors this weekend, told the political leaders that artificial intelligence poses an \"existential threat\" to human civilization. At the bipartisan National Governors Association in Rhode Island, Musk also spoke about energy sources, his own electric car company and space travel. But when Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, grinning, asked if robots will take everyone's jobs in the future — Musk wasn't joking when he responded. Yes, \"robots will do everything better than us,\" Musk said. But he's worried about more than the job market. \"AI is a fundamental existential risk for human civilization, and I don't think people fully appreciate that,\" Musk said. He said he has access to cutting-edge AI technology, and that based on what he's seen, AI is \"the scariest problem.\" Musk told the governors that AI calls for precautionary, proactive government intervention: \"I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it's too late,\" he said. He was clearly not thrilled to make that argument, calling regulation generally \"not fun\" and \"irksome,\" but he said that in the case of AI, the risks are too high to allow AI to develop unfettered. \"I think people should be really concerned about it,\" Musk said. \"I keep sounding the alarm bell.\" It's true: For years, Musk has issued Cassandra-like cautions about the risks of artificial intelligence. In 2014, he likened AI developers to people summoning demons they think they can control. In 2015, he signed a letter warning of the risk of an AI arms race. Musk has invested in a project designed to make AI tech open-source, which he asserts will prevent it from being controlled by one company. And earlier this year, Maureen Dowd wrote a lengthy piece for Vanity Fair about Musk's \"crusade to stop the A.I. apocalypse.\" Dowd noted that some Silicon Valley leaders — including Google co-founder Larry Page — do not share Musk's skepticism, and describe AI as a possible force for good. Critics \"argue that Musk is interested less in saving the world than in buffing his brand,\" Dowd writes, and that his speeches on the threat of AI are part of a larger sales strategy. Back at the governors conference, some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development. Musk said the first step would be for the government to gain \"insight\" into the actual status of current research. \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid,\" Musk said. \"As they should be.\"",

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world. Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures. Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:   Leaders in the U.K. want to make it illegal to drive a car with a gasoline or diesel engine. Britain's environmental secretary says the country will ban the sale of new gas or diesel vehicles by 2040. The plan is to phase out all cars with internal combustion engines by 2050. And this has become a movement in Europe. France and Norway have announced similar plans with pressure growing in Germany to do the same. To talk about the prospect of an all-electric, gas-free Europe is NPR's Sonari Glinton, who joins us from the studios of Youth Radio in Oakland, Calif. Hello there.  SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Hey.  MCEVERS: So what's the reason for the ban on gasoline and diesel in the U.K.? Is it about more than climate change?  GLINTON: Well, yes, it is in a real way about air quality. Air quality has become a really important political issue in England. As a matter of fact, electric cars and clean air was a part of the election, and it was a part of the conservative platform during this year's election. Pollution in - is getting better. But here's the key thing - in many big U.K. cities, harmful pollutants such as particulate soot and nitrogen oxides, NOx - these are the key ingredients or some of the key ingredients of smogs - that - those levels have barely dropped at all. And no doubt, this is about climate change in the long term, but right now there is a political problem. And a controversial study shows that about 40,000 Brits die prematurely connected to pollution.",

    "text": "Moonlighting: The controversy among India's tech workers\nRemote work has allowed some Indian tech workers to take on two jobs or pursue side hustles – but some firms are not happy. Every day Diya, a 32-year-old from Bangalore, logs on remotely for an eight-hour shift as a software engineer in an IT company. She works hard – but once the workday is over, she stays in professional mode: logging on to her second job, also in IT. “I am very good with animation and am doing a project where actually I make almost as much as I do in my main job, working less hours. It also helps me hone my skills and increase my revenue stream,” she says.    Diya is moonlighting: holding down a full-time job, while simultaneously selling her skills to another employer. She doesn’t see anything wrong with it; her organisation requires her to work around 40 hours per week, and as long as she does that honestly, she believes there’s no reason she shouldn’t have a side hustle.  Yet not everyone is so blasé about moonlighting. Rishad Premji, the chairman of Indian tech and consulting firm Wipro, which recently fired 300 workers for taking second jobs with rival companies, spoke out strongly about moonlighting in the tech industry: “This is cheating - plain and simple,” he tweeted.  While the phenomenon exists in other nations, it’s a contentious debate in India, particularly within the tech sector. Veena Gopalakrishnan, a partner specialising in employment law at AZB & Partners, Bangalore, says that while moonlighting isn’t new in India, it’s “become more rampant post-pandemic, with employees working remotely, infrequent or relaxed employer supervision, and increased time and bandwidth for employees to take up another job”.  The Wipro firings have increased conversations around the topic; some companies have issued dire warnings to employees not to work for other firms, or are trying to increase worker monitoring. Other business leaders are taking a more relaxed line, arguing that young people are only trying to get ahead. What’s clear is that, as technology opens up more avenues for ambitious young workers to sell their skills and top up their income, companies will need to work out what they will and will not allow workers to do in a way that makes sense to both parties. Motivated or ‘cheating’?  That some people are moonlighting is an open secret in the Indian tech sector. According to a survey by Mumbai-based Kotak Institutional Equities, nearly 65% of IT employees said they or someone they knew had been moonlighting or pursuing part-time opportunities while working from home time.  This is no surprise – it’s a young workforce, in a big, developing sector. IT companies with huge numbers of employees struggle to create a sense of ownership and loyalty among their workforces. Young tech workers, meanwhile, are fully bought into hustle culture; getting ahead financially often takes more money than one job pays. Salaries are comparatively high in Bangalore, India’s IT capital, but so too are living costs. As well as increasing earnings, many workers also want to upskill or pursue a passion. And remote work has made doing this easier; workers can fit a second job around their main job, and reap the benefits.  Rajan, 28, works full time for a leading software company in Bangalore, and also has his own YouTube Channel, which he monetises through advertisements and runs anonymously. “I belong to a middle-class family and have ambitions of studying abroad, and this will help me fund it,” he says. “The pandemic made me realise that one has to be prepared for the unexpected and have a buffer of savings. I work from home, so I am able to manage both well.”  Diya rejects the idea that she might be cheating her primary employer, saying that she’s not slacking off at her job. “When I am a good performer at my primary job, and give it my best, and then work for someone else after working hours, I only think that makes me an extremely motivated and hard-working person, not one who is cheating or shirking.” Yet as Wipro’s response to its moonlighting employees shows, employers may not share that view.  Employment-law expert Gopalakrishnan says, legally, the picture is complex – whether an employee can take an extra job or side-hustle depends predominantly on the employment contract with the primary employer. “Organisations usually include an ‘exclusivity clause’, which necessitates that the employee devotes their entire working hours to the business interests of the employer and does not engage in any other business or activity,” she says.  Some companies do allow employees to take on side-hustles or passion projects by prior agreement, provided there are no conflicts of interest, she adds, but it is rare for employers to be comfortable with employees taking jobs where “there is a conflict of interest, a risk to confidential or proprietary information, or likelihood of the employee’s productivity being impacted”.    Possible conflict of interest appeared to be at the heart of the Wipro firings. Chairman Rishad Premji said that the affected workers were moonlighting for the company’s competitors, something that he called a “complete violation of integrity in its deepest form”. And Pradeep Gopi, head of HR at Cloudphysician Health Care services and noted HR expert, says that this sentiment is understandable: “Most companies have an objection with moonlighting when their resources are used by the employee to advance a competitor’s business, or when the employee loses focus on the main job at hand thanks to the distraction of the secondary job.”",

    "text": "The Indian messaging app that wants to take on WhatsApp\nCan an Indian-made messaging app compete with the behemoth that is WhatsApp? Over the past couple of weeks, Arattai, developed by Indian tech company Zoho, has become a viral sensation in the country. The company says it saw seven million downloads in \"seven days last week\", without specifying the dates. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Arattai's downloads were less than 10,000 in August. Arattai, which means banter in the Tamil language, had a soft launch in 2021, but not many had heard of it. The sudden surge in its popularity is being linked to the federal government's push for self-reliance as India deals with the impact of steep US trade tariffs on its goods. It's a message that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers have repeated over the past few weeks - make in India and spend in India. Federal minister Dharmendra Pradhan said as much when he posted about Arattai on X a fortnight ago urging people to use \"India-made apps [to stay] connected\". Since then, several other ministers and business leaders have also posted about Arattai.  The company says the push from the government \"definitely contributed to the sudden surge in Arattai downloads\".  \"In just three days, we saw daily sign-ups increase from 3,000 to 350,000. In terms of our user base's active users, we saw a 100X jump, and that number is continuing to rise,\" Zoho CEO Mani Vembu told the BBC, adding that this also shows that users are \"enthusiastic about a homegrown product that can meet all their unique needs and requirements\". The company has not provided details about their active users, but experts say that they are still a far cry from the 500 million monthly active users that Meta's WhatsApp has in India.  India is WhatsApp's biggest market and the app is almost a way of life in the country, with people using it for everything from sending bulk good morning wishes to running their businesses. Arattai has features similar to WhatsApp, and allows users to send messages and make voice and video calls. Both apps also offer a set of business tools and, just like WhatsApp, Arattai claims that it is built to operate smoothly on low-end phones and even on slow internet speeds. Many users have praised Arattai on social media, with some saying that they liked its interface and design while others felt that it matched WhatsApp in usability. Many also took pride in it being an Indian-made app and encouraged others to download it. Arattai isn't the first Indian app to dream of replacing huge international rivals. In the past, Indian-made apps such as Koo and Moj had been touted as replacements for X and TikTok (after the Indian government banned the Chinese app in 2020), respectively, but they never really took off after their initial success. Even ShareChat, once touted as the big rival to WhatsApp, has tempered its ambitions. Delhi-based technology writer and analyst Prasanto K Roy says that it will be difficult for Arattai to break through WhatsApp's extensive user base, especially as the Meta-owned platform hosts a large number of businesses and government services on the platform. Arattai's success will depend on its capacity to not just amass new users but also retain them, he says, which cannot be driven by nationalist sentiment alone. \"The product has to be good, but even then, it's unlikely that it will be able to replace an app that has billions of existing users in the world,\" Mr Roy adds.",

Updated at 9 p.m. ET President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the broad legal protections enjoyed by social media companies, two days after he tore into Twitter for fact-checking two of his tweets. \"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly,\" Trump said from the Oval Office. \"A small handful of powerful social media monopolies control the vast portion of all private and public communications in the United States.\" The president said the tech companies have \"unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter\" a large sphere of human interaction. \"They have points of view,\" he said.   The Trump administration hopes the order will eventually set the stage for new regulations on tech platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.  But legal experts said they were doubtful the move would have any practical effect on the tech giants. Legal observers described the action as \"political theater,\" arguing that the order does not change existing federal law and will have no bearing on federal courts.   Twitter, in a statement, called Trump's order \"a politicized approach to a landmark law,\" saying attempts to erode the decades-old legal immunity may \"threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms.\" The president's latest confrontation with Twitter was set off after the tech company placed fact-checking warnings on two of his tweets that claimed, without evidence, that casting ballots by mail allows for voter fraud. Both Democratic and Republican states have used voting by mail for years without reports of widespread fraud.  Trump lashed out at Twitter, comparing the fact-checking labels to censorship and accusing the social media giant of stifling conservative voices, though the president did not provide any examples to back up his assertion.  The president, who often uses Twitter as a megaphone to tout his victories and blast his critics to his more than 80 million followers, said Thursday that if he had the legal authority to do so, he would completely shut down Twitter.  \"I think I'd be hurting it very badly if we didn't use it anymore,\" Trump said from the White House. \"We have other sites we can use, I guess, or we'd have to develop other sites.\"  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Wednesday that the platform will continue to warn users about factual distortions on it.

Councillor Rachel Reed set up Fly Doncaster (Auxiliary Services) Ltd with Councillor David Knight, who was also a Reform UK councillor until he was stripped of the party whip over the saga. The party has said the business was Knight's idea and Reed - who had worked in a school before entering politics - was unaware of the implications it would have. Reed will remain as a councillor for Conisbrough ward and has resigned as a director of Fly Doncaster (Auxiliary Services) Ltd.  According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), Doncaster Reform UK has appointed Councillor Karl Hughes as deputy leader. Fly Doncaster (Auxiliary Services) Ltd was established on 18 September after the council created Fly Doncaster to manage Doncaster Sheffield Airport (DSA). Earlier this month, Reform spokesperson Jason Charity said Fly Doncaster (Auxillary Services) Ltd was Knight's idea, as he \"thought that the auxiliary services around DSA have not been established, and he thought there was a business opportunity in it\". Charity, who is also a councillor for Conisbrough ward, said the business was legal but \"not something that Reform UK would have approved\".  Both Reed and Knight were members of the Overview and Scrutiny Management Committee (OSMC) at City of Doncaster Council, which is responsible for reviewing and scrutinising decisions made by Mayor Ros Jones and her cabinet. This includes upcoming decisions related to the airport, after the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority approved £160m to help with its reopening. Following the controversy, Knight was removed from the OSMC by Councillor Guy Aston, who leads Reform UK on City of Doncaster Council.  Knight lost the party whip the next day, making him an independent councillor. Reed was chair of the OSMC and stepped down from the role the same day Knight lost the party whip, but stayed on as deputy leader of the group until this week. Aston said: \"Rachel has chosen to resign as deputy leader to ensure that nothing distracts from the work ahead.",

The Commons authorities said they do not comment on individual cases, but a \"rigorous\" process was in place to assess arrangements for MPs. It comes amid an escalating war of words between Reform and Sir Keir Starmer over Labour attacks on Farage during its party conference in Liverpool.  Speaking to the BBC, Yusuf accused the prime minister of co-ordinating a \"campaign of incitement to violence\" against Farage, adding that the Reform UK leader had been subjected to \"unprecedented vilification\" by ministers. It comes after Sir Keir described Reform UK's policy of scrapping indefinite leave to remain as \"racist\" and accused Farage of not liking Britain. Reform has accused the prime minister of describing Farage and the party's supporters as racists, something Sir Keir has denied. Yusuf accused Sir Keir of \"circling the drain\", claiming polling showed Labour members want Sir Keir to stand down as the party's leader. \"So how's he responded? He's responded by co-ordinating the most unprecedented vilification and campaign of incitement to violence against the man who, frankly, he knows he cannot beat at the ballot box,\" he said. He added that the attacks on Farage this week had come \"in the context\" of the decision to downgrade the Reform UK leader's security by Parliament's security team, which manages security for both MPs and members of the House of Lords. Speaking earlier to Times Radio, he added that the decision was made \"from what I can tell, for inexplicable reasons\", without elaborating further. In his BBC interview, Yusuf said that \"reasonable people\" would be able to question whether the decision was appropriate, given Reform UK's rise in national opinion polls since last year's general election. Speaking to Radio 5 Live at Labour conference, Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden dismissed the idea that security decisions were political, adding it was an operational matter \"for the police and the security authorities\". The Parliamentary Security Department is responsible for security within Parliament, and works with police forces, who are responsible for security outside of the parliamentary estate. MPs are provided with security based on their risk.  In May last year the previous government announced a £31m package to increase security provision for MPs.",

This summer's massive protests over police brutality, spurred by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, demanded significant changes in policing.  Those protests have moved some cities and states to \"reimagine\" what departments could look like through changes in funding and legislation. Some efforts stalled, like in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed.  Some saw success, like in Colorado, New York and Virginia, which all passed sweeping new laws months ago. They address use of force, funding and community oversight, among other things, though the long-term effects of those new laws won't be known for a while.  Other efforts that deal with specific reform measures are on the Nov. 3 ballot in several cities and states.   Here's a look at what changes are being sought:  Seven local ballot initiatives center around civilian oversight of police, shifting money from criminal justice to social services, and evaluating the size of police departments.    Los Angeles County: Measure J, Los Angeles County Community Investment and Alternatives to Incarceration.  This measure would amend the county's charter and require the allocation of money from the general fund (no less than 10% by the summer of 2024) for housing, mental health care and programs considered alternatives to incarceration.  The money could not be spent on the Sheriff's department and other county law enforcement agencies. Supporters say it resets county spending to address long standing inequities- especially in communities of color.  Oakland: Measure S1 would strengthen oversight of the Police Department by building on an earlier measure approved four years ago which established a civilian based Police Commission. It expands the powers of the commission and the Community Police Review Agency (CPRA). It creates the Office of Inspector General, which would review cases of police misconduct and CPRA  investigations. It also makes the commission independent—taking it out of the city and police department's chain of command.  Backers of the measure say it increases public trust and police accountability.    San Diego, Measure B. In recent years, activists have pushed for a stronger community review board.  Measure B changes civilian oversight of the San Diego Police Department from the advisory Community Review Board on Police Practices to the Commission on Police Practices which would have the power to subpoena witnesses and conduct investigations into police officer misconduct. It would review complaints against officers and investigate all deaths that are a result of police interaction, including in-custody deaths. The commission would be independent of the Mayor and the city police department.  San Francisco: Proposition D, Sheriff Oversight. The measure would set up two new oversight bodies for the San Francisco County Sheriff's Department.  The Sheriff's Department Oversight Board would make policy recommendations.  The Sheriff Department's Office of Inspector General would conduct investigations of in-custody deaths and complaints and make policy recommendations on police use of force.  The ballot question comes in the wake of misconduct allegations that have been made about the Sheriff's Department in recent years.   The city's Proposition E calls for amending the city's charter to remove the mandatory police staffing level of a minimum of 1,971 full-duty sworn officers. Instead it requires the police department to conduct regular evaluations — every two years — and to recommend staffing levels in a report to the Police Commission. The Commission would hold a public hearing on the report and consider it when approving the Police Department's budget. City officials call the current staffing requirement arbitrary, the San Francisco Police Association says the department is understaffed and opposes the change  San Jose: Measure G expands the authority of San Jose's independent police auditor to review reports and records related to officer-involved shootings and uses of force that resulted in injury or death. Currently the auditor does not have access to those documents. In September, the City Council approved a plan to work with the public to address several criminal justice issues including use of force complaints. ",

    "text": "Cryptocurrency: UK Treasury to regulate some stablecoins\nThe Treasury has announced that it will regulate some cryptocurrencies as part of a wider plan to make the UK a hub for digital payment companies. So-called \"stablecoins\" will become recognised forms of payment to give people confidence in using digital currencies, it said.  Stablecoins are designed to have a stable value linked to traditional currencies or assets like gold. They are considered less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.  The Treasury also said it planned to consult on regulating a much wider range of digital currencies later this year, without saying which they might be. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"We want to see the [cryptocurrency] businesses of tomorrow - and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term.\" The Treasury has not yet confirmed which stablecoins will be regulated; well-known ones include Tether and Binance USD.  Stablecoins are currently used in the United States to facilitate trading, lending or borrowing of other digital assets. However, they are not without controversy. Tether, a Hong Kong based company, has faced questions over its business practices and was fined $41m in 2021 by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission for allegedly misstating its reserves. The UK's Treasury said regulating stablecoins would ensure they could be used \"safely\" by the public. Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital currencies that can be traded or used to buy goods and services, although not many shops accept them yet and some countries have banned them altogether. They are exchanged via \"peer-to-peer\" transactions, meaning there are no banks or other third parties involved. Wild fluctuation in the value of some digital currencies has led regulators to warn they pose risks. However, they are increasingly going mainstream, with major financial companies now investing in them.  Meanwhile, Tesla founder Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, has voiced his support for virtual currencies and said Bitcoin is a \"good thing\".

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File) LONDON (AP) — The European Union’s sweeping set of beefed-up cryptocurrency rules got final approval from member states Tuesday, giving the 27-nation bloc a global lead in regulating the freewheeling sector.  The European Council adopted the package of rules — known as Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA — in the final step of the bloc’s legislative process. European Parliament lawmakers endorsed the rules in April, and they’re expected to start taking effect in phases starting in July 2024.  The tighter European scrutiny follows a spate of high profile crypto scandals including the collapse of trading firm FTX and the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin.  The rules are aimed at improving transparency and combating money laundering and will cover stablecoins — which are usually tied to a hard currency or a commodity like gold that make them less volatile than normal cryptocurrencies.  Other digital tokens as well as bitcoin-related services such as trading platforms and digital wallets are also subject to the rules, but not bitcoin itself.  “Recent events have confirmed the urgent need for imposing rules which will better protect Europeans who have invested in these assets, and prevent the misuse of crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism,” said Swedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Council.  Under MiCA, which has been in the works since 2020, crypto companies will need approval to operate in the EU and be held liable if they lose investors’ assets. Authorities will compile a public list of “noncompliant” companies.  \n The rules, aimed at maintaining financial stability, include provisions to combat market manipulation and insider dealing. Companies issuing or trading crypto assets will have to disclose information on the risks, costs and charges that consumers face.  Major crypto companies will have to reveal how much energy they use. The massive amount of energy used in bitcoin mining to create new coins has stoked concern about crypto’s carbon footbprint.  The U.S. has made little progress in stepping up oversight of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, while the U.K. is considering feedback on proposed crypto regulations that it outlined last year.  Some European countries, like Germany, already have basic crypto regulations.",

He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated — Jan. 20, 2025.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia joins supporters in a protest rally outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore, Aug. 25, 2025. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough, File) \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A U.S. immigration judge has denied a bid for asylum from Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has become a proxy for the partisan power struggle over immigration policy. The judge in Baltimore on Wednesday rejected an application to reopen Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum case, but that is not the final word. Abrego Garcia has 30 days to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.  The Salvadoran national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the United States illegally as a teenager. In 2019, he was arrested by immigration agents. He requested asylum but was not eligible because he had been in the U.S. for more than a year. But the judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador, where he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.  He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by President Donald Trump’s administration in March and was held in a notorious prison, and his case soon became a rallying point for those who oppose the Republican president’s immigration crackdown. Facing a ruling from the Supreme Court, the administration returned him to the U.S. in June, only to immediately charge him with human smuggling.  Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges in Tennessee, based on a 2022 traffic stop. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is also seeking to deport him to a third country, proposing Uganda first and then Eswatini, a small country in southern Africa where the king still holds absolute power. His attorneys have denounced the criminal charges and the deportation efforts, saying they are an attempt to punish him for standing up to the administration.  Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case is a calculated risk. If approved, asylum could provide him with a green card and a path to citizenship.

    "text": "Tories would require English and Welsh education in every council\nCouncils would be required to offer both English and Welsh education should the Welsh Conservatives form the next Welsh government, the party's leader in the Senedd has said. Gwynedd announced plans earlier this year to slash English-language education in the majority of its secondary schools. Speaking at Tory conference in Manchester, Darren Millar said he supported both Welsh and English medium schools, but said the council should \"respect the right of parents to choose.\" A spokesperson for the local authority, Cyngor Gwynedd, said its policy ensured pupils were prepared \"to step confidently into a bilingual world\". Millar announced the policy at conference fringe event about education in Wales, where he and Shadow Welsh Secretary, MP Mims Davies, laid out their plans for educational reform in Wales including introducing free schools and academies. Gwynedd, where Welsh is spoken by the majority of residents, plans to phase out English-medium streams from the vast majority of secondary schools.  It would expect pupils to follow at least 70% of the curriculum in Welsh. The plan, according to the council, would remove \"bilingualism and bilingual teaching\" with Welsh becoming \"the principal language of education\". Millar told BBC Wales he was \"disappointed\" in Cyngor Gwynedd. \"I think they ought to respect the right of people to choose, parents to choose and pupils to choose to be educated in an English-medium school\", he said. \"We would require every local authority and change the law if necessary to make sure that that happened\", he added. The council said the authority's language education policy \"is a core part of Cyngor Gwynedd's language strategy and is in line with the strategy's central priority, which is to maintain and strengthen the Welsh language while ensuring that our learners are also prepared to step confidently into a bilingual world\". \"The council will build on the solid foundations that already exist here in Gwynedd's schools, ensuring consistency in terms of provision.\" Millar also said the WJEC, the leading examination body in Wales, should be sanctioned for its performance, and more choice of qualification bodies should be introduced. The WJEC was fined £35,000 this summer after issuing hundreds of schoolchildren in England with the wrong GCSE results.",

Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The White House is asking nine major universities to commit to President Donald Trump’s political priorities in exchange for more favorable access to federal money. Many of the demands mirror those made by his administration as it slashed billions of dollars in federal money for Harvard, Columbia and others accused of liberal bias. WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is asking nine major universities to commit to President Donald Trump’s political priorities in exchange for more favorable access to federal money. A document sent to the universities encourages them to adopt the White House’s vision for America’s campuses, with commitments to accept the government’s priorities on admissions, women’s sports, free speech, student discipline and college affordability, among other topics. Signing on would give universities “multiple positive benefits,” including “substantial and meaningful federal grants” and “increased overhead payments where feasible,” according to a letter sent to universities alongside the compact. The letter calls it a proactive effort as the administration continues to investigate alleged civil rights violations at U.S. campuses. Called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” it asks universities to accept the government’s definition of gender and apply it to campus bathrooms, locker rooms and women’s sports teams. It asks colleges to stop considering race, gender and a wide range of student demographics in the admissions process and to require undergraduate applicants to take the SAT or ACT. Students cross the campus of Dartmouth College, March 5, 2024, in Hanover, N.H. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)  The 10-page proposed agreement was sent Wednesday to some of the most selective public and private universities: Vanderbilt, the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Texas, the University of Arizona, Brown University and the University of Virginia. It was not clear how these schools were selected or why. The nine universities could become “initial signatories” and are being invited to provide feedback before the language is finalized, according to the letter. It asks for a decision by Nov. 21. The memo represents a shift in strategy as the administration offers a reward — not just punishment — as an incentive for adopting Trump’s political wish list. Many of the demands mirror those made by his administration as it slashed billions of dollars in federal money for Harvard, Columbia and others accused of liberal bias. A federal judge overturned cuts at Harvard in September, saying the government had overstepped its authority. Several universities said they were reviewing the compact and had no comment. A statement from the University of Virginia said there was nothing to suggest why it was chosen. The university’s interim president assembled a group of administrators on Thursday to review the letter. Leaders of the Texas system were “honored” that the Austin campus was chosen to be a part of the compact and its “potential funding advantages,” according to a statement from Kevin Eltife, chair of the Board of Regents. “Today we welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it,” Eltife said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said if any universities in his state sign the compact, they will lose access to state funding, including Cal Grants, a $2.8 billion student financial aid program. In an all-capital statement, Newsom, a Democrat, said California “will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom.”",

    "text": "Tories pledge to cut bills as energy price battle takes shape\nThe Conservatives are promising to roll back green energy rules to cut energy costs,  amid an emerging election battleground over the cost of household bills. The party has announced it would scrap carbon pricing and \"rip-off wind subsidies\", claiming they add 20% to electricity prices. It is the latest move from the party under leader Kemi Badenoch to turn the page on the net zero agenda that the party previously advocated in office. It comes after she opened the party's annual conference with a pledge to scrap the UK's landmark climate laws previously championed by predecessor Theresa May. Now the Tories have revealed further details of their plans to ditch green energy rules, as they join an increasingly crowded field of promises between the political parties over how to keep family bills down. The party is promising that if elected, it would abolish the post-Brexit carbon pricing system put in place by Boris Johnson as a key part of his net zero plans. It also says it would cut renewable energy subsidies by ending a regime of 20-year green energy certificates, originally introduced by Labour Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, which is currently due to continue until 2037. The Tories are promising that scrapping the two schemes would knock a combined £165 off the average household energy bill. By contrast, Labour is promising that its plan to decarbonise British electricity will cut domestic bills by £300 a year. Reform UK, meanwhile, has argued scrapping \"net zero madness\" could save families £1,000 a year.  As with the broader pitch on the economy, the Conservatives are hoping that voters will see its promises as more credible than those of Reform, which has leapfrogged it in the polls since its drubbing at last year's election. During a speech to outline the policy at the conference in Manchester, shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho treated delegates to a series of slides on the effect of wind-farm pricing auctions. Wielding a remote control that brought up a succession of graphs, she sought to persuade activists - and the voters at home - that \"anyone with half a brain can see that won't cut bills\". It was a point she tried to ram home during a later fringe event, where she branded Reform's £1,000 pledge \"nonsense\" and compared it to Jeremy Corbyn's eye-catching promise of free broadband at the 2019 election. Asked why voters would not simply opt for the party promising the biggest cut, she argued voters \"do actually look at the credibility of plans\" on the cost of energy, as they \"are so worried about it\".
