He accused it of overseeing \"managed decline\" of the nation and deemed Starmer's recent recognition of a Palestinian state as one of the \"most deeply cynical and morbid acts\" he'd seen in his lifetime. Reform UK were also in the line of fire, with Polanski branding Nigel Farage a \"Trump-loving, tax-avoiding... corporate stooge\". The slogan Polanski chose for his podium was \"bold politics\" Polanski proposed a ream of policy measures, from a wealth tax on the wealthiest 1% in the UK to an end to private water companies.

    "text": "â€˜How do you laugh about death?â€™: the comedians tackling climate change\nComedians and comedy programs have started to find ways to speak to the climate crisis in their work but how can something so heavy create laughter? When David Perdue applied to be part of a climate comedy program, he felt a little out of his element: “I couldn’t recall one time I’d ever had a conversation with my friends about climate change,” said the Atlanta-based comic. Perdue, who is Black, added, “But I knew it was an issue that was going to affect people who look like me, so I wanted to use comedy to address that.” Perdue was one of nine comedians who took part in a nine-month fellowship where they learned about climate science and solutions and collaborated on new, climate-related material. The Climate Comedy Cohort produced shorts, toured together, and pitched ideas to television networks. Their work is part of a broader effort to bring some levity to a topic that is increasingly present in everyday life. For Perdue, that meant bringing race into the conversation about sustainability and clean energy. “[Solar power] is free labor, and the most American thing to do is to use free labor,” he says in one of his sets. “We just have to tell people the sun is Black.” Climate change has increasingly featured in television dramas and apocalyptic thrillers. But comedians like Perdue, as well as higher-profile acts like Michelle Wolf and Joel Kim Booster, are also taking on the climate crisis. (Wolf, in her HBO special, says that “Mother Nature is trying to kill us in the most passive-aggressive way possible. She’s like, ‘What? I raised the temperature a little.’”) By talking about climate, even irreverently, social scientists say, they may be helping to combat climate doom and boost civic engagement. Comedy – even if it’s about heavy topics like climate change – can motivate feelings of hope and optimism, said Caty Borum, a professor at American University and author of The Revolution Will Be Hilarious: Comedy for Social Change and Civic Power. “Those are routes to persuasion because we’re being entertained and because we’re feeling emotions of play – and this is particularly important for climate change,” she said. The Climate Comedy Cohort, a joint project between American University’s Center for Media & Social Impact, which Borum runs, and Generation180, a clean-energy non-profit, announced a new class of comedians earlier this month. “As it just turns out, the very unique qualities of comedy that allow us to break through taboo, allow us to use social critique, and translate topics, all of that really contributes” to people feeling like they can take action, Borum said. Actor and former Obama aide Kal Penn hosts a new show on Bloomberg called Getting Warmer that focuses on climate technology and solutions “with a dose of humor and optimism”, according to its tagline. And in April, a group of comedians is putting on a show in Los Angeles called lol climate change: a show. A majority of Americans says climate change is real and caused by humans, but only about half think there’s anything they can do about it, according to a 2022 AP-NORC poll. Borum said that programs like hers can help combat climate doom and inaction. “The goal of the program is not to have comedians tell more scary stories about climate change, but to really dig in on the solutions,” she said. Just because climate change is heavy and important, it doesn’t mean comedy about it can’t be really silly, said Esteban Gast, a comedian who helped create the Climate Comedy Cohort. He noted that comedy often draws from tragedy. Marc Maron’s new special, From Bleak to Dark, delves into the death of his partner, Lynne Shelton; in Nanette, Hannah Gadsby opens up about being sexually assaulted. “It’s the comedian’s job to pull from that,” Gast said. On stage, Katie Hannigan, part of the Climate Comedy Cohort notes that gas stoves are horrible for the planet. She says, “I am doing my part for climate change. I have never even used my gas stove … since I started that fire.”",

    "text": "Rupert Murdoch stepping down as Fox and News Corp chair, with son Lachlan taking over â€“ as it happened\nThis live blog is now closed. For our latest reporting on the Murdochs, you can read our latest stories: Rupert Murdoch, the US global media magnate, is stepping down at 92 from the business empire he started expanding in his native Australia at the age of 21, it was announced on Thursday. In a note to staff first reported in the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, he wrote: “For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change. But the time is right for me to take on different roles.” After decades of wrangling and the smash-hit television drama series Succession that appeared to mirror all too closely the power struggles of the Murdoch business clan, one of the most powerful media and, by extension, political figures of the 20th and 21st centuries is handing over the keys to his eldest son Lachlan. Murdoch’s publicly-traded company News Corp, headquartered in New York, owns hundreds of local, national and international news outlets. In the US the company owns the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, a conservative-leaning tabloid. Also book publisher HarperCollins. In the UK he owns the dailies The Sun and The Times and owned the now-defunct News of the World weekly scandal sheet. He is famous/infamous for union-busting in the 1980s and influence over and secret deal-making with Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher. In Australia, News Corp owns The Daily Telegraph, the Herald Sun, and The Australian. In the television business, News Corp also owns the US’s right-wing channel Fox News, through the Fox Corporation, and, down under, Sky News Australia. Murdoch was the owner of Britain’s Sky News until 2018 and the film company now called 21st Century Fox until 2019. Forbes estimates Rupert Murdoch enjoys a net worth of US $21.7bn. Here is a wrap up of the day’s key events and reactions following Rupert Murdoch’s announcement of his resignation from Fox and News Corp: Fox said in an announcement on Thursday that Murdoch would become chairman emeritus of both companies. Murdoch vowed to remain engaged at Fox, saying, “I will be involved every day in the contest of ideas.” His older son, Lachlan, 52, will become News Corp chairman and continue as chief executive officer of Fox Corp. “On behalf of the Fox and News Corp boards of directors, leadership teams, and all the shareholders who have benefited from his hard work, I congratulate my father on his remarkable 70-year career,” he said. Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of the media watchdog Media Matters for America, called Murdoch’s legacy “one of deceit.” Carusone went on to warn Lachlan Murdoch’s succession will likely intensify misconduct and misinformation, saying, “Lachlan certainly is a less competent leader than his father, but his worldview is considerably more brutal.” In an interview with LBC presenter Andrew Marr, UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt called Rupert Murdoch a “formidable operator” an “one of the giants of his era.” Reflecting on Murdoch’s resignation, Hunt said: “He is someone, who love him or loathe him, had a defining influence on all of our lives over the last half century.” British television host Piers Morgan hailed Rupert Murdoch’s media legacy following his resignation announcement. “It’s been a privilege to work for him on and off for the past 30 years, and an ongoing masterclass in journalism & business,” Morgan said. The Lincoln Project, an anti-Donald Trump Republican organization responded to Rupert Murdoch’s resignation by saying, “Don’t be fooled by this news.” “Rupert & Fox’s legacy will forever be putting in Trump in the White House & poisoning millions of minds across America,” it added.",

Think \"climate change activist\" and a young, liberal student may come to mind.    A recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll showed climate change is the top issue for Democratic voters. For Republicans, it barely registers overall, but there is a growing generational divide.  A recent Pew Research Center survey shows Republicans 18 to 39 years old are more concerned about the climate than their elders. By a nearly two-to-one margin they are more likely to agree that \"human activity contributes a great deal to climate change,\" and \"the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change.\"   Some of these young conservatives are starting environmental groups and becoming climate activists. And now they're pushing their party to do more.  Benji Backer started the American Conservation Coalition in 2017, after his freshman year in college, and says his love of nature comes in part from his family.  \"They were Audubon members, Nature Conservancy members. But they were conservative, and I grew up not thinking that the environment should be political at all,\" says Backer.  Yet these days, environmental politics dominates his life. From now until the November election Backer is driving an electric car across the country, talking about his group's climate agenda and posting videos along the way. The #ElectricElection Podcast is about to be LIVE from the Tetons. As we start our journey this week, join us at https://t.co/VBo4dnyEA5@ACC_National @tcc_national @USChamber pic.twitter.com/XYzwIgYQRu Backer is promoting his group's American Climate Contract, which is a conservative, market-focused response to the Green New Deal. He's critical of fellow conservatives who ignore climate change. He praised Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg when they both testified before Congress last year. And Backer says he wants to work with liberal climate activists to pass legislation.  So, how will he vote in November? \"If President Trump wants to get my vote, he's going to have to prioritize climate change in a way that he has not done over the past four years,\" says Backer. ",

Neela Banerjee is NPR's chief climate editor. The Environmental Protection Agency just announced plans to reconsider 31 rules and policies that largely address climate change or aim to reduce pollution from burning fossil fuels. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described it as \"the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.\" But announcing big changes to environmental rules doesn't undo facts on the ground overnight. EPA provided no details about whether it plans to weaken rules or get rid of them, as NPR reported. Instead, EPA's announcement is the first step in what is likely to be a lengthy process to remake the rules and policies it targeted. President Trump has called climate change a hoax and railed against wind turbines, energy efficiency standards and electric vehicles. He signed an executive order that halted billions of dollars to a vast range of climate and environmental projects under the previous administration's Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The impact of that move was felt immediately: community groups and corporations alike found their grant money frozen, leading to stalled projects and layoffs. Amending federal rules and regulations is different — changes are likely to be felt over a much longer time horizon.. That's because the foundational environmental laws of the country prescribe a process for making and unmaking rules. The EPA has to publish what its new rule will look like–a \"proposed rule. EPA then seeks public comment on the rule and responds to that feedback. It also must get input from other federal agencies that might be affected by the changes EPA proposes. Industry and advocates have an opportunity to weigh in. The process takes months, if not longer, before a final rule is issued. If the Trump administration tries to short-circuit these processes, its critics will likely sue and the courts could rule against EPA on process grounds. In any event, environmental advocates are likely to sue the regulator on most, if not all, the announced changes. That could further slow things down. Another variable is the administration's plan to slash EPA's staff and spending. Changing rules in a way that survives court challenges takes specialized staff. But cuts loom for EPA at a time when it has pledged to move simultaneously to redo 31 rules and policies, a huge lift regardless of staffing. The impact of EPA's vision will play out in Washington, the courts and ultimately, in communities. NPR will continue to report on what all that means for human health, the climate and the broader environment. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Eyewitness Gebreweld Tesfaye told the BBC that a sizeable number of the worshippers decided to climb onto the makeshift scaffolding to view a newly painted mural on the church ceiling when disaster struck. \"The staircase was entirely wooden, and there were many people moving upstairs at the time. As the congregants were going, the wooden structure gave way, leading to the collapse,\" Mr Gebreweld said. Other eyewitnesses said that chaos ensued, as people scattered in panic or tried to save the lives of people trapped beneath the rubble. Mr Fikre told the BBC that as soon as he heard of the disaster, he rushed to the church, and then to a health centre to look for his mother, but she was not at either place.  \"My cousin called me after that. And then I went to the hospital. Her body was there,\" Mr Fikre said.  She was among the 36 dead, with the emergency services saying that the death toll could rise as some of the injured, numbering about 200, were in a critical condition. Some of them have been transferred to Addis Ababa, about 70 km (45 miles) away, for treatment. The archbishop of the local diocese, Megabi Hadis Nekatibeb, described the disaster as \"incredibly tragic and heart-breaking\".  Mr Fikre said life would not be the same for him and his younger brother without their mother.  \"She raised us by making and selling tella [a locally brewed liquor],\" he told the  BBC.  The government expressed its condolences to the relatives of the victims, and said  that \"safety must be given priority\" during all construction projects.",

    "text": "Reform leader's door 'always open' despite press ban\nA Reform UK council leader has said his door is \"always open\" to a local newspaper, despite refusing to speak to its reporters. Nottinghamshire County Council leader Mick Barton has not spoken to journalists from the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, since August. Law firm CMS LLP served the council with a legal letter on Tuesday on behalf of Reach, the organisation that runs the publisher, calling for the ban to be withdrawn in full. Barton told the BBC the authority would respond \"by teatime\" on Thursday, adding he was \"sure it'll be positive news for everyone\", without giving further details. He said: \"My door is always open, and they can come and see me. \"I want to work with everyone, I've said that from day one. Let's see what happens.\" Barton, who was speaking to the BBC earlier about a row over a local government reorganisation report, added the Post had \"been obsessed with me in the last few weeks... putting up two or three posts about me a day\". The publication declined to comment on Barton's comments when approached by the BBC. The context and scope of the ban has been unclear since it was introduced. According to the Post, it was prompted by an article about local government reorganisation, written by its agenda editor Oliver Pridmore. The council previously told the BBC the ban barred Barton and his party's councillors from speaking to the Post and the LDRS reporters \"with immediate effect\". The authority also stopped sending press releases to the publication and inviting them to council events. But Barton later clarified the ban only applied to the issuing of press releases and for him personally. At the time, senior editor Natalie Fahy said she was \"very concerned\" by the \"unprecedented ban\". In response, Barton said the party would not \"allow misinformation to shape the narrative of our governance\". Barton later lifted the ban for the three BBC-funded Local Democracy Reporting Service journalists, who work out of the publication.",

Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This undated photo provided by Kathy Bloomgarden shows former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers. (Kathy Bloomgarden via AP) \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology’s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet’s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania. And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.  Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world’s most valuable company — worth $550 billion in March 2000 — before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco’s stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career. Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley’s most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company’s stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago. While remaining Cisco’s chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI’s transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. \n Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s? \n A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters. In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren’t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it? ",

Brian Sandoval during the third day of the National Governors Association's meeting on Saturday in Providence, R.I. Among other things, Musk warned governors that artificial intelligence poses a \"fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk, speaking to U.S. governors this weekend, told the political leaders that artificial intelligence poses an \"existential threat\" to human civilization. At the bipartisan National Governors Association in Rhode Island, Musk also spoke about energy sources, his own electric car company and space travel. But when Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, grinning, asked if robots will take everyone's jobs in the future — Musk wasn't joking when he responded. Yes, \"robots will do everything better than us,\" Musk said. But he's worried about more than the job market. \"AI is a fundamental existential risk for human civilization, and I don't think people fully appreciate that,\" Musk said. He said he has access to cutting-edge AI technology, and that based on what he's seen, AI is \"the scariest problem.\" Musk told the governors that AI calls for precautionary, proactive government intervention: \"I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it's too late,\" he said. He was clearly not thrilled to make that argument, calling regulation generally \"not fun\" and \"irksome,\" but he said that in the case of AI, the risks are too high to allow AI to develop unfettered. \"I think people should be really concerned about it,\" Musk said. \"I keep sounding the alarm bell.\" It's true: For years, Musk has issued Cassandra-like cautions about the risks of artificial intelligence. In 2014, he likened AI developers to people summoning demons they think they can control. In 2015, he signed a letter warning of the risk of an AI arms race. Musk has invested in a project designed to make AI tech open-source, which he asserts will prevent it from being controlled by one company. And earlier this year, Maureen Dowd wrote a lengthy piece for Vanity Fair about Musk's \"crusade to stop the A.I. apocalypse.\" Dowd noted that some Silicon Valley leaders — including Google co-founder Larry Page — do not share Musk's skepticism, and describe AI as a possible force for good. Critics \"argue that Musk is interested less in saving the world than in buffing his brand,\" Dowd writes, and that his speeches on the threat of AI are part of a larger sales strategy. Back at the governors conference, some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development. Musk said the first step would be for the government to gain \"insight\" into the actual status of current research. \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid,\" Musk said. \"As they should be.\"",

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

(AP) — The state of Georgia and local governments are giving $1.8 billion in tax breaks and other incentives to Hyundai Motor Group in exchange for the automaker building its first U.S. plant dedicated to electric vehicles near Savannah, according to the signed agreement disclosed Friday. The deal calls for Hyundai to invest $5.5 billion in its Georgia plant and hire 8,100 workers. It’s the largest economic development deal in the state’s history and comes just months after Georgia closed another major deal with electric vehicle maker Rivian to build a factory in the state. “Not only do these generational projects solidify our spot at the vanguard of the EV transition, but they also ensure that thousands of Georgians across the state will benefit from the jobs of the future,” Pat Wilson, the state’s economic development commissioner, said in a statement. Hyundai executives and Gov. Brian Kemp announced the deal in May with a champagne toast at the project’s sprawling 2,900 acre (1,170 hectare) site in Bryan County, west of Savannah. Hyundai plans to start construction on the plant next year and begin producing up to 300,000 vehicles per year in 2025. The new factory also will produce vehicle batteries.",

Many European politicians and regulators see electric autos as critical for reducing air pollution.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:   Leaders in the U.K. want to make it illegal to drive a car with a gasoline or diesel engine. Britain's environmental secretary says the country will ban the sale of new gas or diesel vehicles by 2040. The plan is to phase out all cars with internal combustion engines by 2050. And this has become a movement in Europe. France and Norway have announced similar plans with pressure growing in Germany to do the same. To talk about the prospect of an all-electric, gas-free Europe is NPR's Sonari Glinton, who joins us from the studios of Youth Radio in Oakland, Calif. Hello there.  SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Hey.  MCEVERS: So what's the reason for the ban on gasoline and diesel in the U.K.? Is it about more than climate change?  GLINTON: Well, yes, it is in a real way about air quality. Air quality has become a really important political issue in England. As a matter of fact, electric cars and clean air was a part of the election, and it was a part of the conservative platform during this year's election. Pollution in - is getting better. But here's the key thing - in many big U.K. cities, harmful pollutants such as particulate soot and nitrogen oxides, NOx - these are the key ingredients or some of the key ingredients of smogs - that - those levels have barely dropped at all. And no doubt, this is about climate change in the long term, but right now there is a political problem. And a controversial study shows that about 40,000 Brits die prematurely connected to pollution.",

    "text": "The people who hate working from home\nThe loudest voices may be remote-work advocates, but plenty of other people can’t get back to the office fast enough. When Lindsay Compton set up her own consultancy business in 2019, working from home seemed like the best option. As a military wife who has moved eight times in the past seven years, and a mother of two young children, she needed something flexible. “It also seemed like quite a good model for being able to deliver really specialist knowledge and not have overheads that were too high,” says the UK-based Compton. But three years later – having built a team of 11 remote workers at Canny Comms, spread from Saudi Arabia to Chester – she admits she’s “desperate” to get back to an office.  “I feel like a teenager working in my very bland spare room, with washing hanging just out of view of the computer camera,” she says. Compton believes offices come with multiple benefits, including enabling colleagues to feed off each other's energy. “Having an office space where you have good light and a good environment can just make you feel a little inspired, and I think it enables you to be a bit more brave.” Yes, lots of people looking to bag a remote working role right now – but there are also plenty of people who are just as keen to get back to the office. According to a 2022 study by PwC, 11% of US workers would prefer to work full-time in the office, and 62% said they’d like to spend at least some time there. More than half (51%) of managers are also confident their employees would be keen to return to the office full-time, according to GoodHire. The motivations of these people might vary – some long for the sociability of the office, while others prefer a clear boundary between work and home. But regardless, companies will need to work out how to accommodate the needs of people who want to be in offices as well as those who don’t, as they map out their post-pandemic working models. ‘I miss catching up with people’ While many people love the flexibility that remote work brings, for others the loss of an office environment and the social contact it provides can be a major blow. “I would never apply for a home or remote-working role,” says Abi Smith, business manager at food producer Spice Kitchen. The 30-year-old was “lucky enough” to spend just six weeks working from home during the pandemic while briefly furloughed from her previous role, and since then has worked full-time in her Liverpool office. She even values the daily commute. “Even when I was furloughed for a few weeks… not having a routine where you get up, leave the house, and socialise and interact with other people throughout the day, I think that can massively affect your mental health. Not to leave your house for long periods of time, I don’t think it’s good for you.” Carol, who works in donor support at a major US charity, says she was devastated when the organisation made the decision to close its city office and move all staff to remote working. “I live in a small flat where there isn’t a spare room so I spend all day on my laptop on the couch,” she says. “Though I can spend all day on video calls with people, it just doesn’t feel the same as when we were all together in an office. My days lack variety, and I just miss catching up with people in person, and finding out how they’d spent their weekend or what they were working on.” This loss of connection and lack of structure can have a profound impact for some people. According to a May 2021 study by the American Psychiatric Association, nearly two-thirds of people who spend at least some time working from home say they’ve felt isolated or lonely from time to time. For 17%, that’s a constant feeling. Individual family circumstances might feed into how acutely workers miss the office too; studies have shown that during lockdown, people living with family members or a partner experienced far fewer problems with their mental health.    ‘Office equals work mode’ It isn’t only wellbeing and social contact that some workers fear is at stake if they spend all day at home, though. It’s also their career prospects.  Only 40% of UK workers surveyed by employment and HR specialists WorkNest are confident that office-based and home-based staff will be rewarded equally in the next 12 months, according to research shared with BBC Worklife. And of full-time remote workers, two thirds are concerned about missing out on development opportunities by being based at home, according to PwC. Michal Laszuk, a 27-year-old based in Warsaw, Poland, associates being in the office with delivering a better quality of work. Laszuk spent a lot of time working at home during the pandemic in his previous role, but when he started his new job as a community manager for passport and visa service PhotoAid he was allowed to choose how he worked. He immediately chose the office.",

    "text": "Moonlighting: The controversy among India's tech workers\nRemote work has allowed some Indian tech workers to take on two jobs or pursue side hustles – but some firms are not happy. Every day Diya, a 32-year-old from Bangalore, logs on remotely for an eight-hour shift as a software engineer in an IT company. She works hard – but once the workday is over, she stays in professional mode: logging on to her second job, also in IT. “I am very good with animation and am doing a project where actually I make almost as much as I do in my main job, working less hours. It also helps me hone my skills and increase my revenue stream,” she says.    Diya is moonlighting: holding down a full-time job, while simultaneously selling her skills to another employer. She doesn’t see anything wrong with it; her organisation requires her to work around 40 hours per week, and as long as she does that honestly, she believes there’s no reason she shouldn’t have a side hustle.  Yet not everyone is so blasé about moonlighting. Rishad Premji, the chairman of Indian tech and consulting firm Wipro, which recently fired 300 workers for taking second jobs with rival companies, spoke out strongly about moonlighting in the tech industry: “This is cheating - plain and simple,” he tweeted.  While the phenomenon exists in other nations, it’s a contentious debate in India, particularly within the tech sector. Veena Gopalakrishnan, a partner specialising in employment law at AZB & Partners, Bangalore, says that while moonlighting isn’t new in India, it’s “become more rampant post-pandemic, with employees working remotely, infrequent or relaxed employer supervision, and increased time and bandwidth for employees to take up another job”.  The Wipro firings have increased conversations around the topic; some companies have issued dire warnings to employees not to work for other firms, or are trying to increase worker monitoring. Other business leaders are taking a more relaxed line, arguing that young people are only trying to get ahead. What’s clear is that, as technology opens up more avenues for ambitious young workers to sell their skills and top up their income, companies will need to work out what they will and will not allow workers to do in a way that makes sense to both parties. Motivated or ‘cheating’?  That some people are moonlighting is an open secret in the Indian tech sector. According to a survey by Mumbai-based Kotak Institutional Equities, nearly 65% of IT employees said they or someone they knew had been moonlighting or pursuing part-time opportunities while working from home time.  This is no surprise – it’s a young workforce, in a big, developing sector. IT companies with huge numbers of employees struggle to create a sense of ownership and loyalty among their workforces. Young tech workers, meanwhile, are fully bought into hustle culture; getting ahead financially often takes more money than one job pays. Salaries are comparatively high in Bangalore, India’s IT capital, but so too are living costs. As well as increasing earnings, many workers also want to upskill or pursue a passion. And remote work has made doing this easier; workers can fit a second job around their main job, and reap the benefits.  Rajan, 28, works full time for a leading software company in Bangalore, and also has his own YouTube Channel, which he monetises through advertisements and runs anonymously. “I belong to a middle-class family and have ambitions of studying abroad, and this will help me fund it,” he says. “The pandemic made me realise that one has to be prepared for the unexpected and have a buffer of savings. I work from home, so I am able to manage both well.”  Diya rejects the idea that she might be cheating her primary employer, saying that she’s not slacking off at her job. “When I am a good performer at my primary job, and give it my best, and then work for someone else after working hours, I only think that makes me an extremely motivated and hard-working person, not one who is cheating or shirking.” Yet as Wipro’s response to its moonlighting employees shows, employers may not share that view.  Employment-law expert Gopalakrishnan says, legally, the picture is complex – whether an employee can take an extra job or side-hustle depends predominantly on the employment contract with the primary employer. “Organisations usually include an ‘exclusivity clause’, which necessitates that the employee devotes their entire working hours to the business interests of the employer and does not engage in any other business or activity,” she says.  Some companies do allow employees to take on side-hustles or passion projects by prior agreement, provided there are no conflicts of interest, she adds, but it is rare for employers to be comfortable with employees taking jobs where “there is a conflict of interest, a risk to confidential or proprietary information, or likelihood of the employee’s productivity being impacted”.    Possible conflict of interest appeared to be at the heart of the Wipro firings. Chairman Rishad Premji said that the affected workers were moonlighting for the company’s competitors, something that he called a “complete violation of integrity in its deepest form”. And Pradeep Gopi, head of HR at Cloudphysician Health Care services and noted HR expert, says that this sentiment is understandable: “Most companies have an objection with moonlighting when their resources are used by the employee to advance a competitor’s business, or when the employee loses focus on the main job at hand thanks to the distraction of the secondary job.”",

    "text": "The Indian messaging app that wants to take on WhatsApp\nCan an Indian-made messaging app compete with the behemoth that is WhatsApp? Over the past couple of weeks, Arattai, developed by Indian tech company Zoho, has become a viral sensation in the country. The company says it saw seven million downloads in \"seven days last week\", without specifying the dates. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Arattai's downloads were less than 10,000 in August. Arattai, which means banter in the Tamil language, had a soft launch in 2021, but not many had heard of it. The sudden surge in its popularity is being linked to the federal government's push for self-reliance as India deals with the impact of steep US trade tariffs on its goods. It's a message that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers have repeated over the past few weeks - make in India and spend in India. Federal minister Dharmendra Pradhan said as much when he posted about Arattai on X a fortnight ago urging people to use \"India-made apps [to stay] connected\". Since then, several other ministers and business leaders have also posted about Arattai.  The company says the push from the government \"definitely contributed to the sudden surge in Arattai downloads\".  \"In just three days, we saw daily sign-ups increase from 3,000 to 350,000. In terms of our user base's active users, we saw a 100X jump, and that number is continuing to rise,\" Zoho CEO Mani Vembu told the BBC, adding that this also shows that users are \"enthusiastic about a homegrown product that can meet all their unique needs and requirements\". The company has not provided details about their active users, but experts say that they are still a far cry from the 500 million monthly active users that Meta's WhatsApp has in India.  India is WhatsApp's biggest market and the app is almost a way of life in the country, with people using it for everything from sending bulk good morning wishes to running their businesses. Arattai has features similar to WhatsApp, and allows users to send messages and make voice and video calls. Both apps also offer a set of business tools and, just like WhatsApp, Arattai claims that it is built to operate smoothly on low-end phones and even on slow internet speeds. Many users have praised Arattai on social media, with some saying that they liked its interface and design while others felt that it matched WhatsApp in usability. Many also took pride in it being an Indian-made app and encouraged others to download it. Arattai isn't the first Indian app to dream of replacing huge international rivals. In the past, Indian-made apps such as Koo and Moj had been touted as replacements for X and TikTok (after the Indian government banned the Chinese app in 2020), respectively, but they never really took off after their initial success. Even ShareChat, once touted as the big rival to WhatsApp, has tempered its ambitions. Delhi-based technology writer and analyst Prasanto K Roy says that it will be difficult for Arattai to break through WhatsApp's extensive user base, especially as the Meta-owned platform hosts a large number of businesses and government services on the platform. Arattai's success will depend on its capacity to not just amass new users but also retain them, he says, which cannot be driven by nationalist sentiment alone. \"The product has to be good, but even then, it's unlikely that it will be able to replace an app that has billions of existing users in the world,\" Mr Roy adds.",

Updated at 9 p.m. ET President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at limiting the broad legal protections enjoyed by social media companies, two days after he tore into Twitter for fact-checking two of his tweets. \"We're here today to defend free speech from one of the gravest dangers it has faced in American history, frankly,\" Trump said from the Oval Office. \"A small handful of powerful social media monopolies control the vast portion of all private and public communications in the United States.\" The president said the tech companies have \"unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter\" a large sphere of human interaction. \"They have points of view,\" he said.   The Trump administration hopes the order will eventually set the stage for new regulations on tech platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.  But legal experts said they were doubtful the move would have any practical effect on the tech giants. Legal observers described the action as \"political theater,\" arguing that the order does not change existing federal law and will have no bearing on federal courts.   Twitter, in a statement, called Trump's order \"a politicized approach to a landmark law,\" saying attempts to erode the decades-old legal immunity may \"threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms.\" The president's latest confrontation with Twitter was set off after the tech company placed fact-checking warnings on two of his tweets that claimed, without evidence, that casting ballots by mail allows for voter fraud. Both Democratic and Republican states have used voting by mail for years without reports of widespread fraud.  Trump lashed out at Twitter, comparing the fact-checking labels to censorship and accusing the social media giant of stifling conservative voices, though the president did not provide any examples to back up his assertion.  The president, who often uses Twitter as a megaphone to tout his victories and blast his critics to his more than 80 million followers, said Thursday that if he had the legal authority to do so, he would completely shut down Twitter.  \"I think I'd be hurting it very badly if we didn't use it anymore,\" Trump said from the White House. \"We have other sites we can use, I guess, or we'd have to develop other sites.\"  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Wednesday that the platform will continue to warn users about factual distortions on it.

    "text": "Reform councillor quits role over airport company\nA Reform UK councillor has stepped down as deputy leader of the Doncaster branch of the party over her involvement in a company she co-founded to do business with the council.  Councillor Rachel Reed set up Fly Doncaster (Auxiliary Services) Ltd with Councillor David Knight, who was also a Reform UK councillor until he was stripped of the party whip over the saga. The party has said the business was Knight's idea and Reed - who had worked in a school before entering politics - was unaware of the implications it would have. Reed will remain as a councillor for Conisbrough ward and has resigned as a director of Fly Doncaster (Auxiliary Services) Ltd.  According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), Doncaster Reform UK has appointed Councillor Karl Hughes as deputy leader. Fly Doncaster (Auxiliary Services) Ltd was established on 18 September after the council created Fly Doncaster to manage Doncaster Sheffield Airport (DSA). Earlier this month, Reform spokesperson Jason Charity said Fly Doncaster (Auxillary Services) Ltd was Knight's idea, as he \"thought that the auxiliary services around DSA have not been established, and he thought there was a business opportunity in it\". Charity, who is also a councillor for Conisbrough ward, said the business was legal but \"not something that Reform UK would have approved\".  Both Reed and Knight were members of the Overview and Scrutiny Management Committee (OSMC) at City of Doncaster Council, which is responsible for reviewing and scrutinising decisions made by Mayor Ros Jones and her cabinet. This includes upcoming decisions related to the airport, after the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority approved £160m to help with its reopening. Following the controversy, Knight was removed from the OSMC by Councillor Guy Aston, who leads Reform UK on City of Doncaster Council.  Knight lost the party whip the next day, making him an independent councillor. Reed was chair of the OSMC and stepped down from the role the same day Knight lost the party whip, but stayed on as deputy leader of the group until this week. Aston said: \"Rachel has chosen to resign as deputy leader to ensure that nothing distracts from the work ahead.",

    "text": "Donors covering Farage security after cuts, Reform claims\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage's publicly-funded security detail has been cut by 75%, the party's head of policy has claimed. Zia Yusuf said the decision had been taken two weeks ago by parliamentary officials for \"inexplicable reasons\", with party donors stepping in to \"ensure that his security is shored up\". The Commons authorities said they do not comment on individual cases, but a \"rigorous\" process was in place to assess arrangements for MPs. It comes amid an escalating war of words between Reform and Sir Keir Starmer over Labour attacks on Farage during its party conference in Liverpool.  Speaking to the BBC, Yusuf accused the prime minister of co-ordinating a \"campaign of incitement to violence\" against Farage, adding that the Reform UK leader had been subjected to \"unprecedented vilification\" by ministers. It comes after Sir Keir described Reform UK's policy of scrapping indefinite leave to remain as \"racist\" and accused Farage of not liking Britain. Reform has accused the prime minister of describing Farage and the party's supporters as racists, something Sir Keir has denied. Yusuf accused Sir Keir of \"circling the drain\", claiming polling showed Labour members want Sir Keir to stand down as the party's leader. \"So how's he responded? He's responded by co-ordinating the most unprecedented vilification and campaign of incitement to violence against the man who, frankly, he knows he cannot beat at the ballot box,\" he said. He added that the attacks on Farage this week had come \"in the context\" of the decision to downgrade the Reform UK leader's security by Parliament's security team, which manages security for both MPs and members of the House of Lords. Speaking earlier to Times Radio, he added that the decision was made \"from what I can tell, for inexplicable reasons\", without elaborating further. In his BBC interview, Yusuf said that \"reasonable people\" would be able to question whether the decision was appropriate, given Reform UK's rise in national opinion polls since last year's general election. Speaking to Radio 5 Live at Labour conference, Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden dismissed the idea that security decisions were political, adding it was an operational matter \"for the police and the security authorities\". The Parliamentary Security Department is responsible for security within Parliament, and works with police forces, who are responsible for security outside of the parliamentary estate.

Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Boats navigate the Nanay River in the community of Belen in Iquitos, Peru, March 23, 2021. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd, File) BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — A South American trade bloc ruled Monday that Peru is failing to meet its commitments to curb illegal gold mining and mercury trafficking, siding with Indigenous groups who say their Amazon rivers and food supply are being poisoned. The decision by the Andean Community — which includes Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia — orders Peru to urgently reform its laws, seize machinery that sucks up river sediment and other mining equipment, and end extensions of a registry for informal miners that critics say shields illegality.  It is the first time the Andean Community has taken up a case of this kind and formally ruled against a member country as authorities try to find mechanisms to crack down on the growing trade.  Illegal gold mining has spread widely across the Amazon as global demand and soaring gold prices make the trade increasingly lucrative. Analysts expect gold will see gains toward $4,000 per ounce by 2026. Mercury is widely used to separate gold from sediment, but it contaminates waterways, accumulates in fish and builds up in human bodies — posing particular risks to children and pregnant women. Peru has 20 working days to comply and report what steps it has taken or plans to take to bring its laws into line. If it fails, the case could be referred to the bloc’s Tribunal of Justice, which has the power to impose binding trade sanctions on member states. The complaint was filed at the end of June by a coalition of Indigenous and rural communities from the Nanay River basin, who say mercury from illegal gold mining is poisoning fish and rivers in Peru’s northern Amazon. Hair samples collected in the area have shown mercury levels far above World Health Organization safety limits, and researchers have linked exposure to rashes, stomach illness and neurological damage. \n “In some way it is a response to the demands of communities affected by mercury contamination, and it is also a message for other countries that they must make the effort to comply and to respect everyone’s right to live in a healthy and adequate environment,” said Peruvian environmental lawyer, César Ipenza. Ipenza said that if the country fails to comply, the sanctions would be economic, such as tariffs on Peruvian products within the four Andean nations. The decision could also set precedent and lead to rulings against other countries, he said.  Peru has launched occasional crackdowns on illegal mercury, including the 2019 “Operation Mercury” raid in the Madre de Dios region in the Peruvian Amazon and a record seizure of contraband mercury earlier this year at the port of Callao. But Indigenous groups say enforcement remains patchy and corrupt networks allow the trade to flourish. The AP did not receive a response for a request to comment from either Peru’s Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism or Ministry of Culture, the government office that oversees Indigenous affairs. “It is a warning to the countries that are destinations for the gold. They must have greater clarity about its origin,¨ Ipenza said. ",

This summer's massive protests over police brutality, spurred by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, demanded significant changes in policing.  Those protests have moved some cities and states to \"reimagine\" what departments could look like through changes in funding and legislation. Some efforts stalled, like in Minneapolis where George Floyd was killed.  Some saw success, like in Colorado, New York and Virginia, which all passed sweeping new laws months ago. They address use of force, funding and community oversight, among other things, though the long-term effects of those new laws won't be known for a while.  Other efforts that deal with specific reform measures are on the Nov. 3 ballot in several cities and states.   Here's a look at what changes are being sought:  Seven local ballot initiatives center around civilian oversight of police, shifting money from criminal justice to social services, and evaluating the size of police departments.    Los Angeles County: Measure J, Los Angeles County Community Investment and Alternatives to Incarceration.  This measure would amend the county's charter and require the allocation of money from the general fund (no less than 10% by the summer of 2024) for housing, mental health care and programs considered alternatives to incarceration.  The money could not be spent on the Sheriff's department and other county law enforcement agencies. Supporters say it resets county spending to address long standing inequities- especially in communities of color.  Oakland: Measure S1 would strengthen oversight of the Police Department by building on an earlier measure approved four years ago which established a civilian based Police Commission. It expands the powers of the commission and the Community Police Review Agency (CPRA). It creates the Office of Inspector General, which would review cases of police misconduct and CPRA  investigations. It also makes the commission independent—taking it out of the city and police department's chain of command.  Backers of the measure say it increases public trust and police accountability.    San Diego, Measure B. In recent years, activists have pushed for a stronger community review board.  Measure B changes civilian oversight of the San Diego Police Department from the advisory Community Review Board on Police Practices to the Commission on Police Practices which would have the power to subpoena witnesses and conduct investigations into police officer misconduct. It would review complaints against officers and investigate all deaths that are a result of police interaction, including in-custody deaths. The commission would be independent of the Mayor and the city police department.  San Francisco: Proposition D, Sheriff Oversight. The measure would set up two new oversight bodies for the San Francisco County Sheriff's Department.  The Sheriff's Department Oversight Board would make policy recommendations.  The Sheriff Department's Office of Inspector General would conduct investigations of in-custody deaths and complaints and make policy recommendations on police use of force.  The ballot question comes in the wake of misconduct allegations that have been made about the Sheriff's Department in recent years.   The city's Proposition E calls for amending the city's charter to remove the mandatory police staffing level of a minimum of 1,971 full-duty sworn officers. Instead it requires the police department to conduct regular evaluations — every two years — and to recommend staffing levels in a report to the Police Commission. The Commission would hold a public hearing on the report and consider it when approving the Police Department's budget. City officials call the current staffing requirement arbitrary, the San Francisco Police Association says the department is understaffed and opposes the change  San Jose: Measure G expands the authority of San Jose's independent police auditor to review reports and records related to officer-involved shootings and uses of force that resulted in injury or death. Currently the auditor does not have access to those documents. In September, the City Council approved a plan to work with the public to address several criminal justice issues including use of force complaints. ",

Ministers estimate up to 10% of UK adults now own some form of crypto. They plan to use existing regulations for the industry, rather than creating a bespoke regime. The Treasury says that will allow crypto to benefit from the \"confidence, credibility and regulatory clarity\" of the existing system for financial services, as set out in the UK's Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). It wants to create a level playing field between traditional and emerging financial services, where the principle is \"same risk, same regulatory outcome\".

The Treasury says its proposals - which it's now consulting on - will: Ministers say the measures will \"mitigate the most significant risks\" of crypto technologies, while \"harnessing their advantages\".

So-called \"stablecoins\" will become recognised forms of payment to give people confidence in using digital currencies, it said.  Stablecoins are designed to have a stable value linked to traditional currencies or assets like gold. They are considered less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.  The Treasury also said it planned to consult on regulating a much wider range of digital currencies later this year, without saying which they might be. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"We want to see the [cryptocurrency] businesses of tomorrow - and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term.\" The Treasury has not yet confirmed which stablecoins will be regulated; well-known ones include Tether and Binance USD.  Stablecoins are currently used in the United States to facilitate trading, lending or borrowing of other digital assets. However, they are not without controversy. Tether, a Hong Kong based company, has faced questions over its business practices and was fined $41m in 2021 by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission for allegedly misstating its reserves. The UK's Treasury said regulating stablecoins would ensure they could be used \"safely\" by the public. Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital currencies that can be traded or used to buy goods and services, although not many shops accept them yet and some countries have banned them altogether. They are exchanged via \"peer-to-peer\" transactions, meaning there are no banks or other third parties involved. Wild fluctuation in the value of some digital currencies has led regulators to warn they pose risks. However, they are increasingly going mainstream, with major financial companies now investing in them.  Meanwhile, Tesla founder Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, has voiced his support for virtual currencies and said Bitcoin is a \"good thing\". Separately, the Treasury said it will ask The Royal Mint to create a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) this summer.",

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File) LONDON (AP) — The European Union’s sweeping set of beefed-up cryptocurrency rules got final approval from member states Tuesday, giving the 27-nation bloc a global lead in regulating the freewheeling sector.  The European Council adopted the package of rules — known as Markets in Crypto Assets, or MiCA — in the final step of the bloc’s legislative process. European Parliament lawmakers endorsed the rules in April, and they’re expected to start taking effect in phases starting in July 2024.  The tighter European scrutiny follows a spate of high profile crypto scandals including the collapse of trading firm FTX and the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin.  The rules are aimed at improving transparency and combating money laundering and will cover stablecoins — which are usually tied to a hard currency or a commodity like gold that make them less volatile than normal cryptocurrencies.  Other digital tokens as well as bitcoin-related services such as trading platforms and digital wallets are also subject to the rules, but not bitcoin itself.  “Recent events have confirmed the urgent need for imposing rules which will better protect Europeans who have invested in these assets, and prevent the misuse of crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism,” said Swedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Council.  Under MiCA, which has been in the works since 2020, crypto companies will need approval to operate in the EU and be held liable if they lose investors’ assets. Authorities will compile a public list of “noncompliant” companies.  \n The rules, aimed at maintaining financial stability, include provisions to combat market manipulation and insider dealing. Companies issuing or trading crypto assets will have to disclose information on the risks, costs and charges that consumers face.  Major crypto companies will have to reveal how much energy they use. The massive amount of energy used in bitcoin mining to create new coins has stoked concern about crypto’s carbon footbprint.  The U.S. has made little progress in stepping up oversight of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, while the U.K. is considering feedback on proposed crypto regulations that it outlined last year.  Some European countries, like Germany, already have basic crypto regulations.",

U.S.-based company Bitfury has been accounting for much of the buzz. Since long before anyone can remember, the big, fertile slopes of the Alazani Valley in eastern Georgia have been planted with grapevines. It's the heartland of winemaking in the country that invented it 8,000 years ago. But in recent months, the valley has been going through a new kind of ferment, because of bitcoin. \"You see that building there with the power line outside,\" says Bezhani Buzhaidze, pointing to an abandoned-looking, cinder block storehouse in his hometown of Telavi, the hub of Georgian wine country. \"That's being turned into a data center for mining cryptocurrencies.\" It's another sign of how this tiny former Soviet republic of fewer than 4 million people has become a virtual printing press for this new money you can't see. Cryptocurrency mining is the digital equivalent of minting real money, except that anyone with the right hardware and software can do it, by taking part in what amounts to a giant virtual competition. Think of it like a lottery, where computers linked across the Internet compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, with the number of players constantly rising. The owner of the computer that finds the right solution is rewarded with a \"block\" of bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, which is then registered and verified on a decentralized database system known as the blockchain. In practice, it involves a kind of constant digital bombardment to find these solutions, 24 hours a day, consuming huge amounts of electricity. And thanks to its cheap hydropower and low regulation, Georgia is now ranked second in the world for cryptocurrency mining — behind only China. A single U.S.-based technology company called Bitfury has been accounting for much of this mining activity, from a vast data center filled with computer servers that it opened on the outskirts of the capital, Tbilisi. It has generated plenty of controversy too over claims that it received overly generous terms for its electricity bills. But scores of smaller data centers have now sprouted up, with many more people mining from home using processors bought online from China. One Georgian political party has even started raising funds by mining cryptocurrency via the computers of willing supporters. And because electricity has traditionally been more heavily subsidized in the Alazani Valley, wine country has been seeing a kind of digital gold rush. Hoodie-wearing Buzhaidze is one of the growing army of home prospectors. He signed up last summer, as he watched the price of bitcoin surge, borrowing several thousand dollars from his father to buy three graphic cards, the backbone of any home mining operation. Ever since, they have been churning away 24 hours a day in the family living room, a constant low hiss emitting from their cooling fans. \n                Bezhani Buzhaidze is one of the growing army of home prospectors for cryptocurrency mining in Georgia.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew North for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Bezhani Buzhaidze is one of the growing army of home prospectors for cryptocurrency mining in Georgia. \"See, here, I've made about $14 so far today,\" Buzhaidze says, scrolling through brightly colored graphs and figures on an app on his smartphone.

The Conservative leader said the UK had \"taken for granted the fact that we have been a fairly cohesive society\" but warned \"things are fragmenting\". But she warned that immigration levels were too high, adding that \"if people come in too quickly, it's impossible to integrate\".  She also defended remarks made by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick who said Handsworth in Birmingham was \"one of the worst-integrated places\" he had ever been to. In a recording reportedly made in March during a dinner and published by the Guardian, the shadow justice secretary said he had not seen \"another white face\" in the hour and a half he spent in Handsworth filming a video about litter. He went on: \"I want to live in a country where people are properly integrated. \"It's not about the colour of your skin, or your faith, of course it isn't. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives.\" Asked about the comments, he told the BBC's Chris Mason: \"There are numerous parts of our country now where the same story is happening, and at the extreme levels, a lack of integration leads us into a very dark place as a country.  \"We're here in Manchester today, a week on from a terrible terrorist attack where a man who lived in our country for 30 years clearly wasn't well integrated, clearly didn't share British values because he went on to murder British Jews.\" His earlier comments have provoked criticism from opposition politicians. Badenoch defended his comments, and said they were made during the bin strike in Birmingham. \"Rubbish piled up in the streets and what were the politicians focusing on - airports in Pakistan and Gaza,\" she said. \"We need people to have their eyes focused on what is going on in this country.\"  Badenoch told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason that immigration was something her party \"got wrong\" in government and that was why she was coming up with \"tougher\" policies including leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and a plan to deport 750,000 illegal immigrants in five years.  In addition to reducing levels of immigration, Badenoch also said the government needed to be \"making sure people understand what our values are\".",

A group of around 100 people marched between The Cenotaph and College Green in the city centre, waving flags, with around 300 counter-protesters stationed nearby. They were intercepted on their march by members of the counter-demonstration, leading to some physical confrontation. Avon & Somerset Police said three people had been arrested on suspicion of either assault or public order offences and are in custody. This is the third organised anti-immigration protest in the city in six weeks. Avon & Somerset Police emphasised ahead of the event that hate and intolerance would not be acceptable from either group and had a large presence, including mounted officers. The force expected a large turnout for the demonstrations. In anticipation of this, separate but adjacent zones were set out for both groups at the beginning and end of the march route. Protester Marcus Leighton, from a group calling itself Bristol Patriots, told BBC West people were fed up with tax and immigration policies, as well as the government, but said the labels given to people with his opinions were unfair. \"We've been called Nazis, which is not true. We're just patriots who love our country,\" he said. \"It's about illegal immigrants, not just immigrants, coming over undocumented, unvetted,\" said another protester, who carried a flag on the march reading \"not racist, just a worried mum\". BBC West also heard from members of the much larger counter-demonstration. One woman said: \"We need to welcome these people into our communities properly. \"It's a very very small percentage, isn't it, who are asylum seekers, but everything's sort of blamed on that.\" A second protester added: \"There's masses of resources that could be used if funded correctly, but it doesn't mean attacking migrants - it means taxing the wealthy.\"",

    "text": "Bethany Black: Life as a transsexual comedian\nIt's difficult to know how to sum myself up. I'm tempted to go the Goodfellas route: as far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a lesbian. I'm often billed these days as \"Britain's only goth, lesbian, transsexual stand-up comedian\". I'm also a vegan and recovering drug addict and alcoholic, but by this point you might as well just call me Beth because pigeonholes become redundant. It's the lesbian and transsexual bit that confuses people. They stare and think that a) I don't look like any of the ones they've seen on Jerry Springer, and b) what's the point of being both? They don't understand that sexuality and gender identity isn't the same thing: gay men don't want to be women, and lesbians don't want to be men. Being trans is like being gay, and as Sarah Silverman says of being a comedian: \"You're just born that way and it's beyond your control.\" Sexuality exists on a spectrum, as does gender identity - mine just both point away from what you'd expect based on biology at birth. When I started doing stand-up I was most of the way through my transition, living \"full-time\", as they say, but pre-surgery. It was 2004 and Peter Kay was popular, and as much as I was a fan at the time I knew my observations wouldn't work like his did: \"I tell you what you don't see anymore ... urinals! Oh, just me on that one ...\" For the first three years I didn't mention being trans at all on stage. I was scared to, and as I \"pass\" very well it wasn't necessary to mention it. For the first six months I was terrified to mention that I was a lesbian, but through repetition it becomes easier and less scary because you know what the reaction will be. Other comics knew I was trans and it led to some in-jokes off stage. I was so comfortable with it that it wasn't an issue, so it was inevitable that I should talk about it in my act eventually. But it's a difficult subject to broach the subject on stage, because it needs time to explain. British comedy audiences start from a position of: \"Go on then, make me laugh!\" First you have to prove that you're funny, and only once they trust you can you get away with talking about things that are outside their comfort zone. Also, people don't like to be confused, and the fact that I'm pretty, a lesbian, and on top of that transsexual, is pretty confusing to your average stag party on a Saturday night. People don't tend to heckle with transphobic comments. I've had a few, but they were borne out of homophobia rather than transphobia. Occasionally an audience member will shout, \"Are you a man or a woman?\", to which I reply: \"Your chat-up technique could do with a little work.\" As a kid I was very bookish and geeky, and really into comedy and science. I sat in my room obsessing about things to escape the dawning realisation that I was transsexual, which was described in the dictionary we had at home as \"someone biologically of one sex with an abnormally strong desire to be of the other sex.\" I've never been sure what an \"abnormally strong desire\" is. I mean, it wasn't abnormal to me - there was very little ab and a whole lot of normal, and if you're basing it on the consensus then surely the word abnormal is redundant? But \"abnormal\" I was to society, so I went from a smiling, happy little blonde kid to a dark black thundercloud of a human. I was on a downward spiral of depression and self-loathing as the gap between my self-image and outward appearance grew day by day. Fortunately, I'm terrible at suicide. I attempted it a couple of times and spectacularly failed: I tried to hang myself and dragged down a ceiling, losing my deposit on the flat; I tried to gas myself in the car and ran out of petrol. Suicide, it seems, is not the easy way out, nor is it painless. Upon reaching rock bottom I decided to get help, and I've never looked back. I'll never forget my mum's response when I told her I was transitioning. She stared at me for a couple of seconds, and then said: \"But we've just had a conservatory built!\" My family was on the whole totally supportive, and some of my friends said: \"That makes sense\". I never had to use all the counter-argument and righteous fury I'd built up to deal with the inevitable intolerance. I felt like a 17-year-old with parents who do understand what they're going through. Still, every time I left the house I was sure that someone would find out my secret and throw rocks at me. No one did.",

    "text": "Museum restoration in Snowdonia will put slate back at centre of Welsh history\nAn up-to-date visitor attraction will serve as the core of the new Unesco world heritage site The deserted quarry above Llanberis in the Eryri national park, formerly Snowdonia, was once part of the thriving slate trade that shaped the social structure, the politics and even the creativity of the whole of Wales. The industry, a source of international pride for generations, has since become something of a post-industrial footnote. But now both the quarrying and “splitting” of Welsh slate are set to regain their historic status. A grant made this summer is providing the means for the transformation of an existing museum at the foot of Wales’s tallest peak, Yr Wyddfa, or Mount Snowdon, that should put slate back at the centre of the country’s cultural story. “Our National Slate Museum is already about the people and their culture and their families and their way of life, as well as about the survival of the Welsh language,” said Jane Richardson, chief executive of Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales. “But we think there’s so much more we can do with it. The new funding is a milestone in the museum’s history that will enable us to connect with communities across Wales and the world.” The slate museum, Amgueddfa Lechi Cymru, is receiving an initial £400,000 grant to allow it to plan an up-to-date visitor attraction that will serve as the core of the new Unesco world heritage site. Three years ago, the region – the Wales slate landscape – won this recognition for its role in “roofing the 19th-century world”. The new development money is designed to enable the museum to follow up by applying for a full grant of £9.4m to complete the job, and was part of a National Lottery Heritage Fund award of more than £15m going out this year to a range of industrial heritage sites across Britain. Slate – ancient, strong, waterproof, yet light and easily cut – became an object of worldwide desire a century and a half ago and changed life in Wales. While the contribution of the coal miners of the valleys has been acknowledged for decades, the significance of the sudden popularity of fine-grained Welsh slate, formed 500 million years ago by the pressures inside vast volcanic slopes, has been comparatively ignored. The scarred landscape left by quarrying remains dramatic evidence of an industry that, while it continues, is now greatly reduced in scale. A trade that once kept hundreds of thousands of workers busy, today employs mere hundreds. A century ago, the Dinorwig miners walked in at dawn from surrounding villages, some travelling from as far as the Isle of Anglesey, and took up their axes on the section of rock, or bargen, on the slope terraces, or poncs, that had each been allotted to their family, like a strip of farmland. Dotted along them were shelters to hide in whenever the shouted warning of the next dynamite blast was heard. Regular payments of “the hospital shilling” funded a little on-site hospital for treating injured workers. It was the kind of insurance miners hoped never to draw upon. The current slate museum opened in 1972, shortly after the quarry finally shut down, and it is housed inside the Grade I-listed Victorian workshops that prepared the slate tiles for sale. The site also contains a terrace of quarrymen’s cottages moved intact from neighbouring Bethesda, as well as working locomotives and the only functioning wagon incline track in Britain, not to mention the wow factor provided by a monumentally huge turning water wheel. The curators plan to bring the workshops closer to their former operational state while allowing visitors to move through the site undercover – just in case the Welsh sun stops shining. The point, though, will continue to be showing how vital the quarries were to the area, driving the speedy development of the new villages and towns of north Wales. When the Great Penrhyn Quarry strike blighted Bethesda, in the next valley, from 1900 to 1903, people starved and the community was left permanently divided. Now tourists swing across the quarry on a zip wire. The miners’ canteens, or cabans, were the focus of quarry social life. These spaces helped to spread the Welsh language among those who came in to work from outside as demand for slate rose. “The rock doesn’t understand English” was a commonly used expression, urging incomers to quickly learn the local terms for the work they did. The cabans also fostered the sort of political and artistic exchanges now synonymous with Welsh culture. Inside the high-beamed caban at Dinorwig, the quarrymen and slate splitters argued about politics and the growth of unionisation that was threatening the jealously guarded status of the self-employed slate miners. All the while, the workers drank tea made from an ever-boiling kettle known as “the fountain”. Across Wales, these rooms also became cradles of modern-era national poetry and singing, with quarry-wide competitive arts festivals, or mini Eisteddfod, regularly staged. Next door to the caban, slate splitters used a technique passed down father to son, sitting on low wooden chairs knocking rock into shape with hammer and chisel, and then “dressing” tiles for sale. Elsewhere this work is now done by machine, but trickier pieces still require human skill. A deft splitter can read the slate and spot flaws in the grain. Water makes the tiles easier to split and damps down the grey dust that quarry owners once argued was so “beneficial” to health. The slopes around Llanberis retain a shocking beauty that predates the day that two landed gentlemen first bought up and developed the local quarries. Dinorwig’s original owner, Thomas Assheton-Smith, is still referred to as the man “who stole the mountain”. It remains the sweeping romantic landscape captured in 1798 by JMW Turner in his painting of Dolbadarn Castle.",

U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to not detain any child who came to the country alone and without permission in ICE adult detention facilities after they become an adult. The Washington, D.C., judge found that such automatic detention violates a court order he issued in 2021 barring such practices. ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond Saturday to emails seeking comment. The push to detain new adults is yet another battle over one of the most sensitive issues in President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda — how to treat children who cross the border unaccompanied by adults.  The Associated Press reported Friday that officials are offering migrant children age 14 and older $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries. Last month a separate federal judge blocked attempts to immediately deport Guatemalan migrant children who came to the U.S. alone back to their home country. Some children had been put on board planes in that late-night operation before a judge blocked it. ",

Kilmar Abrego Garcia joins supporters in a protest rally outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore, Aug. 25, 2025. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough, File) \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A U.S. immigration judge has denied a bid for asylum from Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has become a proxy for the partisan power struggle over immigration policy. The judge in Baltimore on Wednesday rejected an application to reopen Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum case, but that is not the final word. Abrego Garcia has 30 days to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.  The Salvadoran national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the United States illegally as a teenager. In 2019, he was arrested by immigration agents. He requested asylum but was not eligible because he had been in the U.S. for more than a year. But the judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador, where he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.  He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by President Donald Trump’s administration in March and was held in a notorious prison, and his case soon became a rallying point for those who oppose the Republican president’s immigration crackdown. Facing a ruling from the Supreme Court, the administration returned him to the U.S. in June, only to immediately charge him with human smuggling.  Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges in Tennessee, based on a 2022 traffic stop. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is also seeking to deport him to a third country, proposing Uganda first and then Eswatini, a small country in southern Africa where the king still holds absolute power. His attorneys have denounced the criminal charges and the deportation efforts, saying they are an attempt to punish him for standing up to the administration.  Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case is a calculated risk. If approved, asylum could provide him with a green card and a path to citizenship. But if he loses, an immigration judge could remove his protection from being returned to his native country. That could place him back in the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

An economist weighs in\n\n\n      Steve Inskeep\n    \n NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Moody's Chief Economist Mark Zandi about the strength of the economy during the government shutdown.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:    Well, what is a good assessment of the economy, given that we've lost some visibility? We could, as Scott Horsley suggested, check in with the guy at the barbershop who seems to know everything, but the barbershop is not open this early. So we have called Mark Zandi, who is chief economist at Moody's Analytics and has been a guest many times here. Mr. Zandi, welcome back.  MARK ZANDI: Good morning, Steve. Good to be with you.  INSKEEP: We don't know the employment numbers, obviously, but the outside estimates sound like they were not that great. How strong do you think the labor market is?  ZANDI: Not strong. I think it's struggling. Job growth has come to a virtual standstill in recent months. You know, some - you know, we're seeing some job growth in health cares. We heard that in the previous report - hospitality. But we're losing jobs in manufacturing, construction, transportation, distribution, mining. So net-net, we're going nowhere fast. And the real problem is that businesses just aren't hiring. It feels like a hiring freeze across the economy, which is obviously very hard on younger people trying to get into the labor market. Businesses have cut back hours. That's the other way of kind of handling this. They've cut back temp jobs. So they've done everything but lay off, and that's key. The layoffs are the firewall between an economy that continues to grow and avoid recession, and that firewall has not been breached. So businesses aren't laying off. So hopefully that continues to happen. But everything else has, and the job market is struggling.  INSKEEP: Are we doing this to ourselves? By which I mean, the United States government is continuously almost daily changing tariff policies? There's a lot of uncertainty, and so businesses are standing still for that reason? ",

If you're flying soon … Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job, even if that means working without pay while the rest of the federal government shuts down.  Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A \"slight increase\" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos.  If this drags on, travelers could again see more \"sick-outs\" of key personnel, as workers showed their anger over missing paychecks.  Lastly, if you're planning on any international travel in the new year, you may need to build in even more time for passport renewals. U.S. passport agencies will remain open, but it could take longer to process applications with some employees furloughed.

    "text": "Reform Send system now or face billions in extra costs, ministers warned\nSupporting children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England will cost the government an extra £3bn a year by 2029 if the system is not reformed, a think tank has warned. The government is already spending £12bn this year on supporting those with Send, a figure that has risen by 66% in the last decade. Under current projections, there will also be an extra 220,000 children and young people with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) by 2029, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says. A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) says the IFS report is \"further evidence of the broken Send system this government inherited\". A rise in the number children receiving Send support in schools has driven what the IFS calls a \"dramatic and ongoing\" increase in spending. \"The truly shocking thing is that despite this increase in spending, we are still left with a system that is failing to cope with the needs of these children and young people,\" Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said. One in five pupils (1.7 million) in England get some kind of support for special educational needs in school at the moment.  And 482,000 of them (or 5.3% of all pupils) get the higher level of support from individual EHCPs, a legal document setting out a child's tailored support needs, which councils have to provide and pay for.  The rising costs of Send support have forced local authorities into hundreds of millions of pounds of debt. A government agreement meant councils have been able to keep Send deficits off their financial books, and now there are calls for the total debt - which is forecast to reach £5bn next year - to be wiped completely. Amanda Hopgood, of the Local Government Association, says that would \"put councils on a stable financial footing\", as well as addressing \"outdated legislation that leaves councils facing rising and unsustainable costs\". Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats' spokesperson on education, says councils have been \"pushed to the brink\", adding that \"vulnerable young people are being set up to fail\". The IFS is predicting that the proportion of pupils with EHCPs will rise even further in the next four years, to 8% of all pupils aged four to 16.   In July, the government refused to rule out scrapping EHCPs as part of their upcoming reforms. Education minister Georgia Gould has since said \"there will always be a legal right to additional support\", adding that children, families and teachers will be \"at the forefront\" of Send reforms.",

    "text": "Tories would require English and Welsh education in every council\nCouncils would be required to offer both English and Welsh education should the Welsh Conservatives form the next Welsh government, the party's leader in the Senedd has said. Gwynedd announced plans earlier this year to slash English-language education in the majority of its secondary schools. Speaking at Tory conference in Manchester, Darren Millar said he supported both Welsh and English medium schools, but said the council should \"respect the right of parents to choose.\" A spokesperson for the local authority, Cyngor Gwynedd, said its policy ensured pupils were prepared \"to step confidently into a bilingual world\". Millar announced the policy at conference fringe event about education in Wales, where he and Shadow Welsh Secretary, MP Mims Davies, laid out their plans for educational reform in Wales including introducing free schools and academies. Gwynedd, where Welsh is spoken by the majority of residents, plans to phase out English-medium streams from the vast majority of secondary schools.  It would expect pupils to follow at least 70% of the curriculum in Welsh. The plan, according to the council, would remove \"bilingualism and bilingual teaching\" with Welsh becoming \"the principal language of education\". Millar told BBC Wales he was \"disappointed\" in Cyngor Gwynedd. \"I think they ought to respect the right of people to choose, parents to choose and pupils to choose to be educated in an English-medium school\", he said. \"We would require every local authority and change the law if necessary to make sure that that happened\", he added. The council said the authority's language education policy \"is a core part of Cyngor Gwynedd's language strategy and is in line with the strategy's central priority, which is to maintain and strengthen the Welsh language while ensuring that our learners are also prepared to step confidently into a bilingual world\". \"The council will build on the solid foundations that already exist here in Gwynedd's schools, ensuring consistency in terms of provision.\" Millar also said the WJEC, the leading examination body in Wales, should be sanctioned for its performance, and more choice of qualification bodies should be introduced. The WJEC was fined £35,000 this summer after issuing hundreds of schoolchildren in England with the wrong GCSE results.",

Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. The White House is asking nine major universities to commit to President Donald Trump’s political priorities in exchange for more favorable access to federal money. Many of the demands mirror those made by his administration as it slashed billions of dollars in federal money for Harvard, Columbia and others accused of liberal bias. WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is asking nine major universities to commit to President Donald Trump’s political priorities in exchange for more favorable access to federal money. A document sent to the universities encourages them to adopt the White House’s vision for America’s campuses, with commitments to accept the government’s priorities on admissions, women’s sports, free speech, student discipline and college affordability, among other topics. Signing on would give universities “multiple positive benefits,” including “substantial and meaningful federal grants” and “increased overhead payments where feasible,” according to a letter sent to universities alongside the compact. The letter calls it a proactive effort as the administration continues to investigate alleged civil rights violations at U.S. campuses. Called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” it asks universities to accept the government’s definition of gender and apply it to campus bathrooms, locker rooms and women’s sports teams. It asks colleges to stop considering race, gender and a wide range of student demographics in the admissions process and to require undergraduate applicants to take the SAT or ACT. Students cross the campus of Dartmouth College, March 5, 2024, in Hanover, N.H. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)  The 10-page proposed agreement was sent Wednesday to some of the most selective public and private universities: Vanderbilt, the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Texas, the University of Arizona, Brown University and the University of Virginia. It was not clear how these schools were selected or why. The nine universities could become “initial signatories” and are being invited to provide feedback before the language is finalized, according to the letter. It asks for a decision by Nov. 21. The memo represents a shift in strategy as the administration offers a reward — not just punishment — as an incentive for adopting Trump’s political wish list. Many of the demands mirror those made by his administration as it slashed billions of dollars in federal money for Harvard, Columbia and others accused of liberal bias. A federal judge overturned cuts at Harvard in September, saying the government had overstepped its authority. Several universities said they were reviewing the compact and had no comment. A statement from the University of Virginia said there was nothing to suggest why it was chosen. The university’s interim president assembled a group of administrators on Thursday to review the letter. Leaders of the Texas system were “honored” that the Austin campus was chosen to be a part of the compact and its “potential funding advantages,” according to a statement from Kevin Eltife, chair of the Board of Regents. “Today we welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it,” Eltife said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said if any universities in his state sign the compact, they will lose access to state funding, including Cal Grants, a $2.8 billion student financial aid program. In an all-capital statement, Newsom, a Democrat, said California “will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom.”",

Celebrities are becoming a prominent fixture in the debate over K-12 education. This week Whoopi Goldberg used her platform on ABC's The View to speak out against teacher tenure. \"To me, bad teachers don't do anybody any good. So the union needs to recognize that parents are not going to stand for it anymore,\" she said. Goldberg's says she's not sorry her comments on teacher tenure riled The View's audience. Goldberg followed up with a YouTube video, responding to the backlash she'd received after making those statements. Her mother, she notes in the video, was a teacher, and Goldberg describes herself as \"all about teachers.\" \"I like great teachers. I don't like bad teachers, so I don't think bad teachers should be given the gift of teaching forever — badly,\" she says. Goldberg follows Campbell Brown, the former CNN anchor, into the tenure debate ignited by a California lawsuit. David Boies, the high-profile trial lawyer known for his role in the legal challenge that overturned California's gay marriage ban, also recently joined Brown's group, the Partnership for Education Justice. The Celebrity Anti-Common Core Caucus And it's not just teacher tenure. Hollywood is lining up on both sides of the Common Core, too. Comedian Louis C.K., who now boasts more than 3.6 million Twitter followers, used his account to blast the academic standards, long a punching bag for some conservatives and now a growing number of liberals too. \"My kids used to love math,\" he tweeted.\"Now it makes them cry. Thanks standardized testing and common core!\" And he didn't stop there, following up over the next few days with a string of tweets trashing the standards. On David Letterman's show in May, Louis C.K. elaborated, noting that he's the parent of two young girls: \"The tests are written by people that nobody knows who they are. It's very secretive. ... A lot of the year is about the tests. Teaching to the test, they called it.\"",

    "text": "Tories pledge to cut bills as energy price battle takes shape\nThe Conservatives are promising to roll back green energy rules to cut energy costs,  amid an emerging election battleground over the cost of household bills. The party has announced it would scrap carbon pricing and \"rip-off wind subsidies\", claiming they add 20% to electricity prices. It is the latest move from the party under leader Kemi Badenoch to turn the page on the net zero agenda that the party previously advocated in office. It comes after she opened the party's annual conference with a pledge to scrap the UK's landmark climate laws previously championed by predecessor Theresa May. Now the Tories have revealed further details of their plans to ditch green energy rules, as they join an increasingly crowded field of promises between the political parties over how to keep family bills down. The party is promising that if elected, it would abolish the post-Brexit carbon pricing system put in place by Boris Johnson as a key part of his net zero plans. It also says it would cut renewable energy subsidies by ending a regime of 20-year green energy certificates, originally introduced by Labour Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, which is currently due to continue until 2037. The Tories are promising that scrapping the two schemes would knock a combined £165 off the average household energy bill. By contrast, Labour is promising that its plan to decarbonise British electricity will cut domestic bills by £300 a year. Reform UK, meanwhile, has argued scrapping \"net zero madness\" could save families £1,000 a year.  As with the broader pitch on the economy, the Conservatives are hoping that voters will see its promises as more credible than those of Reform, which has leapfrogged it in the polls since its drubbing at last year's election. During a speech to outline the policy at the conference in Manchester, shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho treated delegates to a series of slides on the effect of wind-farm pricing auctions. Wielding a remote control that brought up a succession of graphs, she sought to persuade activists - and the voters at home - that \"anyone with half a brain can see that won't cut bills\". It was a point she tried to ram home during a later fringe event, where she branded Reform's £1,000 pledge \"nonsense\" and compared it to Jeremy Corbyn's eye-catching promise of free broadband at the 2019 election. Asked why voters would not simply opt for the party promising the biggest cut, she argued voters \"do actually look at the credibility of plans\" on the cost of energy, as they \"are so worried about it\".

So, why is most of it untapped? That’s what our listener, Anna in the UK, wants to know. Full disclosure, she’s a geologist and is thoroughly perplexed by the lack of uptake. Geothermal is renewable, reliable and abundant and yet, less than 1% of the world’s energy is generated from it. Host Graihagh Jackson hears about a team in Iceland who hope to \"super-charge\" geothermal power by drilling directly into volcanic magma. And she travels to Germany to visit Vulcan Energy, a company which is combining geothermal with extracting one of the world's most sought-after metals: Lithium. Plus, our reporter in Indonesia tells Graihagh about local opposition to some geothermal power plants. The programme was first broadcast in 2024. Got a question you’d like answered?
